My Personal React Component Library

I'm learning React.js after years of Backbone.js, and I thought the best way to start would be to build my own component library from what I learn.

Current Components:
- Suggestion / Autocomplete input
- Star Ratring
- Tic Tac Toe Game (from Facebook tutorial)


I'll be adding regularly.

Enjoy!
